    XMPP webapp handler classes.

    This module provides handler classes for XMPP bots, including both basic
    messaging functionality and a command handler for commands such as
    "/foo bar".

    Ported from the original App Engine library.

    or backward slash, the handler calls a method named after the command - eg,

    If no handler method matches, unhandled_command is called. The default
    behaviour of unhandled_command is to send the message "Unknown command"
    back to the sender.

    If the user sends a message not prefixed with a slash,
    text_message(message) is called.
